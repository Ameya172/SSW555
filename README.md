# SSW555
# Graph Solver

This project demonstrates a test suite for graph-related algorithms. It includes implementations for finding the shortest path, calculating the minimum spanning tree, and checking for graph isomorphism.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Ameya172/SSW555.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd SSW555
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```shell
pytest
```

The tests will be automatically discovered and executed using the `pytest` testing framework. Test results will be displayed in the console.

## Usage

The main script `main.py` demonstrates how to use the implemented functions. It prompts the user with challenges and verifies their solutions. The challenges include finding the shortest path, calculating the minimum spanning tree, and checking for graph isomorphism.

The script interacts with other modules in the project:

- `utils.py`: Provides utility functions for displaying challenges and obtaining user input.
- `shortest_path.py`: Implements the shortest path algorithm.
- `minimum_spanning_tree.py`: Implements the minimum spanning tree algorithm.
- `graph_isomorphism.py`: Implements the graph isomorphism algorithm.
